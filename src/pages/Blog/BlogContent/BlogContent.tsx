            LinkedIn direct messaging usually limits communication to 1st-degree
            connections, barring a few "open" profiles.
            <br />
            <br />
            Reaching 2nd and 3rd-level connections demands financial investment.
            For example, a LinkedIn Recruiter subscription, priced at around
            $11,000 per year, allows for a scant 150 InMails per month.
            <br />
            <br />
            Fear not, savvy recruiter! There are numerous ways to engage with
            candidates without a paid LinkedIn account. Options include finding
            contact details, sending connection invites, or utilizing a sourcing
            platform to identify profiles with contact information.
            <br />

            This article, though, will focus on the art of sending limitless,
            free messages to candidates via LinkedIn group messaging and the
            power of Noon.ai.

          </h2>

          <p className="lg:text-lg opacity-60">
            LinkedIn groups serve as virtual communities where members connect
            over shared interests.
            <br />
            <br />
            Examples include the bustling 'Venture Capital Cafe' and the techie
            'JavaScript Full Stack Developer' assemblies.
            <br />
            <br />
            In these hubs, thousands of members actively interact and exchange
            ideas.
            <br />
            <br />
            Membership in a group unlocks a world of possibilities: direct
            messages to fellow members are free and virtually unrestricted.

            Identify the Perfect Candidates to Message
          </h2>

          <p className="lg:text-lg opacity-60">
            Within LinkedIn groups, members can only be found by their names.
            Regrettably, filtering group members based on job titles or
            headlines is not possible on LinkedIn.
            <br />
            <br />
            Manually browsing and messaging members is an option, though
            time-consuming. Note that the members' page is not paginated, so
            tracking progress can be challenging.
            <br />
            <br />
            Alternatively, consider using a scraper like Phantombuster or a tool
            like Linked Helper 2 to collect group members and their profile
            details, allowing for filtering based on specific criteria.
